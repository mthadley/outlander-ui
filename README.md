[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mthadley/outlander-ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mthadley/outlander-ui)

Outlander is a dark, flat UI theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Best used with [Outlander-Syntax](https://github.com/mthadley/outlander-syntax).

## Installation
Run the following in a terminal:
```sh
$ apm install outlander-ui outlander-syntax
```
Alternatively, the theme can be installed from the settings menu at **_preferences -> themes_**, from where the theme itself can also be applied.

## Credits
* Outlander colors based on the [Tomorrow-Night-Eighties](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme) color scheme by @chriskempson

### Inspiration

* Its no coincidence that Outlander plays nice with [Numix](https://numixproject.org/)
* [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/)

### Contributing

Feel free to open issues, make suggestions, and create pull requests. If it's a bug or a style tweak thats fits with outlander's aesthetic, it will probably make it in.
